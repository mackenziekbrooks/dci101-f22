Prompts will invite you to dig deeper into readings, discussion topics, or your own experiences. These posts aren't meant to be busy work, rather they're a chance for you to practice thinking critically and analyzing information. They help me know what you're thinking and how you're thinking. Plus, I know that talking a lot in class isn't for everyone. Think of these posts as an extension of your participation. You don't have to know all the answers, just be thoughtful in your questions! General specifications: Create a WordPress post, then turn in the URL in Canvas. 300-500 words. Free from grammatical errors, typos. Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! Activity log # Each week we\u2019ll learn a new skill together in class. The activity log will document the ways you practice and build that skill on your own. Logs will be submitted on your website or as a document in Canvas. Specifications will be specific to each activity. Digital essay # Your big project for this course is the composition of a question-driven digital essay on a topic related to digital culture and information. The digital essay will combine text (1500-2000 words) and a multimedia/digital component using at least one of the analysis methods we learn in class. Work on this project will be distributed throughout the course through research, a proposal, process updates, and a final presentation. The subject of your digital essay is up to you provided it is related to digital culture and information and is approved by the instructor. Essays will be posted to your website. Why an essay? While this might feel like a familiar format to you from high school etc, I'd invite you to put aside what you know about the form. Essay comes from the French to try and that's where you should start your thinking for this assignment. That doesn't mean your standards should be low, but you should think about this assignment as an attempt to do something new. How do you write about digital culture? How do you study it? How do you analyze it? We spend so much of our time on these platforms, but it can be hard to pin down exactly what they're doing. It's hard to analyze something when you don't know how it works! This course is an exploration of the methods for studying digital culture and this assignment should engage at least one of those methods, recognizing that they are new to you and new to other scholars. And recognizing that we have a short time frame to construct these essays! Digital Essay Components # Annotated Bibliography # You are not doing this work in a vacuum! It's important to have a sense of the existing scholarship and research in whatever area you're writing about. We might not have a class in it at W&L, but that does not mean that there's not a scholar out there doing similar work. Knowing where to look and how to look is an essential research skill that will benefit you in college and beyond. We'll have at least one session in class dedicated to finding resources. Specifications: Due October 18th at 12pm. Published to your website, submitted on Canvas. 6-10 sources. 3 must be scholarly sources (books, journal articles, or peer reviewed web sources). Each source should be formatted in an established citation style of your choosing. Use Zotero if it helps! Annotations should be at least two sentences. In the first sentence, summarize the source. In the second sentence, say something about why this source is useful for your project. Proposal # Time to commit! What is your digital essay going to be about? What questions are you interested in asking? What methods are you hoping to use? What drew you to this topic? Specifications: Due Week X Published your website, submitted on Canvas. 300-500 words. Address the following: What is the topic of your project? What led you to this topic? What are some potential research questions (at least two)? What discipline are you situating yourself in? What is your proposed method of analysis? What is your source of data? Tell me about it! What research have you done on your topic? Cite at least 2-3 scholarly sources and any less-than-scholarly sources that are relevant. These can be from your annotated bib, but they should be relevant to the question/topic you've landed on. What will success look like for you? Is there a skill you want to develop? Do you want to advance your knowledge on a particular method or topic? Include a proposed schedule and list of tasks to complete your project. You can adjust this as you go, but it's good to give it some thought now. Digital Essay # Specifications Due Week 12 Published to the web on your domain. You can choose one of the following: A section of your course WordPress site. A new WordPress installation dedicated to your essay. A subdomain built with hand-coded HTML/CSS or a framework like Bootstrap. 1500-2000 words in the main body of the essay. A clearly defined structure to your essay that takes advantage of the digital medium. Don't just copy and paste a Word doc! Use headings or separate pages. In general, you want sections like: introduction, lit review, methods, results, bibliography. But you're free to be creative with how they come together! You can re-use content from previous assignments, but you should revise any text based on feedback and to ensure it flows with the entire essay. Use at least one of the methods we learned this term (data viz, text analysis, web scraping, mapping). How you incorporate these methods is going to depend a lot on your topic and your questions.","title":"Assignments"},{"location":"assignments/#blog-posts","text":"Each week you\u2019ll write a 300-500 word blog post on your website in response to a prompt.

Whether it's for work, school, volunteering, organizing, art, or just for fun, there are plenty of ways to carve out your own corner of the Web. Social media platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook are ubiquitous now, but it used to be that if you wanted to appear in search results, you had to create your own website. If you are a student or navigating the professional world, chances are that 1) someone out there might Google you and 2) you want them to see accurate information and work that you're proud of. A professional website can be a simple single page with limited information, or it can contain your whole life. Chances are, at some point you've relied on information from a personal website. Maybe you found an article you need for a bibliography, a snippet of code that had been giving you trouble, or even an email address for someone who has lost their wallet. If you're conducting research in a field, making art, or selling products, there are others who will be interested in the work you're doing. Check out the sites of others in your intended field of study or career path to see what their websites look like. Some scholars share articles they've written, code libraries, data they've gathered, or new methods they're experimenting with. In the library and digital scholarship world, open and public scholarship is highly valued. Many of the links in this website go to the websites of DH-ers who have been generous enough to share a tutorial or write up their thoughts on a particular method. Whether you create a professional portfolio or not, there is a lot to be said for the form of a website. Most of the scholarship we read, not to mention everything else, has been designed and formatted to be consumed on the Web. Presenting your own work in that format gives you experience with seemingly silly things like getting your images to float nicely with your text or finding a place to reliably store your data. Creating a clean, well-organized website is harder than it looks! Just like it's easier to read a paragraph than to write one, creating a website takes practice. Privacy # All that being said, you do not have to have a strong presence on the Web. You may have personal and legitimate reasons for not wanting to be found in search results. If you're a student, you may not want your homework following you for decades to come. You have the right to privacy and to completing your coursework in a secure way. While you are required to use your domain for this class, you can make it private during the course or remove it after the class is over. The domain provided for you in this class will be de-activated following your graduation, unless you choose to take over ownership. Reclaim Hosting # There are many places to find space on the Web, but many individuals and academic institutions work with Reclaim Hosting , an education-focused web hosting company. Reclaim offers reasonable rates, good support, and an awareness of the needs of academic projects. Some institutions offer a \"domain of one's\" program in which affiliated individuals can obtain a domain. WordPress # Whether you knew it or not, chances are you have visited many, many WordPress websites. WordPress is an open-source content management system used by 42% of the web (as claimed by WordPress). Though it's thought of as a blogging platform, it powers plenty of major websites. We'll use WordPress in this class as a platform for blog posts and your final project. It is easy to install on your domain and has plenty of customization options. It's likely that you might need to use WordPress at a future job, internship, or volunteer venture, so it's a good skill to have. Because of its popularity, there are many resources online for learning or troubleshooting WordPress.

In this course, we'll use something called Specifications Grading . The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technologies and digital methods we will be learning this term, as well as to combat grade anxiety. It is more important to me that you explore and experiment with these methods than it is that you get the \"right answer.\" It's hard to feel comfortable experimenting and making mistakes if you're worried about every little point. So rather than assign points or grades, I will mark each assignment as Complete/Incomplete according to a set of specifications. You must complete a certain number of assignments in each category to receive the corresponding grade, as seen in the table below. This means that your grade is always going up as you complete more assignments. It also means that you must complete the requisite number of assignments in each category to get the grade. You will use Canvas to turn in assignments and to receive feedback. I will mark your assignments as complete/incomplete, however! Canvas will not be able to calculate your current grade with this system. This is a lot to get used to at first, so please ask any questions you have early in the semester. We will do a midterm check-in so you have a good understanding of where you are. Tokens # You're not expected to be perfect at every assignment! To help you recover from any incomplete assignments, you will be assigned three tokens . Using a token will give you one week to revise and resubmit an assignment to receive credit. To use a token, you will submit an entry in Canvas declaring which assignment you're revising. I'll award a point in Canvas for each token you use, but these points are not factored into your final grade. Using a token does not guarantee that you will receive a complete on the resubmission, but hopefully with my feedback you can get there. Grading Scale # To earn a...

Picking a topic Research! What's my project? Research Questions and Data Modeling Creating data Finding data Analyzing your data Case study: Spanish Gallery Resources Picking a topic # First things first, what do you even want to do? Big question, right? Don't worry, it's normal to feel lost at the start. You're probably at the beginning of your academic career and haven't gone through the years of training like most scholars have. You might not feel committed to one discipline or subject area yet. If that's the case, this is your chance to experiment! You can try on a topic like you try on a pair of shoes, spending a little time in them to see if they're still comfortable after walking a mile to the grocery store. For most of you, this is one assignment for one class, not something that has to follow you the rest of your life, unless you want it to. Embrace the ability to travel in your own direction. Some of you may be \"idea people\" and feel like you're brimming with potential topics already. If so, that's great! There will be a section about \"scope\" for you later on. If you need some help generating ideas, it can be helpful to consider these categories: Objects - What thing do you want to learn more about? Is there a book, a moment in history, or an archival collection that has caught your interest? Are you interested in fanfiction about anime, 19th century detective novels, the 1918 pandemic, or perhaps some beautiful illustrated maps you saw in a museum exhibit? Some people are drawn to objects and collections, and work from there. There are lots of ways to source or generate data about objects. You might want to spend your time crafting a beautiful, if small, data set about a set of objects. Questions - What questions keep you up at night? What do you ponder while you run or while you're driving? What have you wondered about while reading for your philosophy class? You might be more of an abstract thinker. How can you approach these questions in a data-driven way? You might be more interested in big approaches to data - what can learn from hundreds or thousands of texts? What patterns can you find through time and space? You should consider working with existing data sets and playing with the kinds of questions and answers you can find. Skills - What do you want to get better at? Some folks are more motivated by improving their own abilities, rather than doing a deep dive into a topic. That's okay too. What skills do you want to work on? How might they transfer to another project or method? Do you want to get really good at data visualization, or maybe play with a new programming language? Or perhaps build confidence with web scraping? Go for it! You can let the software drive your decision making. We need the builders, just as much as we need the analyzers. Research! # Once you have an inkling of what your topic might be, it's time to get researching. You want to get a sense of what is out there already about this topic. You want to find resources that might help with the context, but you also want to see what kind of work has already been done. Save yourself the frustration of getting halfway through a data collection project before you realize that someone has already done this work before. Getting a sense of existing approaches might also help steer you toward your approach. What do similar projects lack? How can you fill in the gaps? Some of you may already be flying through the internet, opening up tab after tab, making notes. But you might also find this part of the process to be paralyzing. It's a wide open world out there. Here are some tips to help you structure this important piece: Structure your research process into phases. Gathering, analyzing, refining, etc. Give yourself time to explore, without deciding whether or not an article, a tutorial, a website is useful or not. You're just trying familiarize yourself with what is out there. You can use a document or something like ZOtero to help. Once you've done your gathering, then spend some time actually reading and considering what you've found. It is useful? Does it help you think about your topic in a new way? Did the title seem great but the content was lacking? Does an article give you a new path to explore? Try to sit with what you've found and think about it before moving on. Once you have a solid sense of what is out there about your topic, it's time to refine and narrow your scope. This stage has its own challenges. It can be hard to make a decision at this stage. You feel pressure to make the right one. Don't worry, you can still pivot if you need to, but remember that there are benefits to making decisions and moving ahead now. You're probably on a deadline and need to get moving onto the next phase of the project. Consider creating a mental or physical \"parking lot\" for ideas or resources that you are intrigued by, but don't have time for right now. You may notice that these tips are conflating the idea of your topic and the research about your topic. That's because at this stage, things are still rather fluid. You may discover that the object, question, or skill that was going to be your topic is just not tenable at this time. Or you may be researching the historical background for one thing and come across an amazing data set for another thing that changes your direction. Enough pep talk! Give me some real tips: Start at the library. Whether it's your library's website or the physical location, browse the resources that your institution has provided for you. Talk to a librarian you know, they love to help. Start local. Every town has its stories. Archives, museums, historical societies, and special collections can hold original or unique materials about the people and places nearby. In this coursebook, we've worked with data about the inhabitants of the local cemetery and the school newspaper. These local stories may not have been analyzed or shared before, but they still have relevance to larger issues. Not all small institutions have the resources to make their holdings available online, so you may have to talk to someone or get creative. Consider the discipline. Don't forget that scholarly work segments itself by discipline, so you may have to navigate those boundaries. Is your topic fundamentally about literature? About history? About philosophy? What other disciplines does it touch? Check out the scholarly organization for that discipline, its major journals, or research centers. What's my project? # Hopefully, if you've read other sections of this coursebook, you have an idea of what humanities data could look like. But what will your data look like? How do you take a topic idea and turn that into data? During the research process, identify and inventory any existing data sets related to your topic. What's there? What's missing? How might you fill in a gap or take your research in a new direction? Start asking questions. What do you want to know? What can you learn from this object/corpus? You don't have to have a firm research question yet, but you should be wondering things. What kind of approach do you want to take? How might that dictate the form of your data? Do you need a list of people and their attributes for network analysis? Do you want to count things and visualize patterns? Do you need place names and coordinates? Consider your limitations. What is your timeframe? What is your skill level? What data is available already and what must you create yourself? Are you working alone or in a team? Do you have access to everything you need? Are you prepared to do a lot of data entry, or do you know that tedious work is not your thing? Set your scope. Then make your scope a little smaller. Trust me. You can always add more later, but when you're new to this kind of work, it's best to start small. If you want to map something, do you need to map the whole country? WOuld it be better to do a region, a state, or even a county? If you're interested in text mining 19th century literature, perhaps a single genre, author, or timespan could serve as a boundary to that work? At this point, you should be at a place where you can write a proposal for your project. You know the types of things you want to do, the questions you want to explore, even if you don't have the answers yet. If you're still stuck, try this flow chart from The Pudding on Writing a Data-Driven Story Research Questions and Data Modeling # In the data section , we covered the mechanics of data modeling. Here, let's cover it as part of the research and project process. Chances are, data modeling will go hand in hand with determining your specific research questions. You will need to iterate over this process a few times before you've arrived at something feasible. What is one potential research question that you can think of? Pay attention to how you begin your question. Are you asking how many? Who? What? How would you answer that question with some kind of data? It can be an unproven, hypothetical answer, but you should think through what kind of answers you're looking for. Now swim around in your answer a little bit. What is your answer made of? Do you need to count something to get to that answer? What do you need to count? Are you tracking something over time, and therefore need time-based data? Are you looking at relationships, so you need information about people? Make a list of all the pieces of information you might need to answer your question. This could be the beginning of your data model. Go through these steps again with a different question and potential answer. How do your data needs compare? Can you start to see a spreadsheet or a corpus forming? Do you need to do more research? How did that go? Hopefully by working through those questions, you should have an idea of where you're headed. Again, it's totally normal to adjust or go through this cycle again. You may even get to the point of visualization and realize you need to regroup. For now, let's assume you're ready to start putting together your data. You have some options. Creating data # You may determine that you need to create your data set from scratch. What does \"from scratch\" mean? Are eggs involved? Chances are you are not going to be pulling data magically from your brain. It's more likely that you will have a source or multiple sources that need to be transformed in a structured data set that can be analyzed by a piece of software. The draft data model you created will guide you in this process. Many humanities data projects begin with the kind of old books that seem to be forgotten about on library shelves. Scholars of past centuries did a lot of data-driven work, they just put all their data into a print book, and now that information needs to be transformed. For example, The Ancient Graffiti Project relies on a 19th century collection of inscriptions gathered into set of large, heavy volumes known as Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum . Mapping the Scottish Reformation is a prosopography project that gathers data about Scottish ministers from a text known as the Fasti . While the author of the Fasti , Hew Scott, did tremendous work in compiling this text, he was loose with the facts and didn't cite his sources. In the end, both of these projects will provide a database and visualizations for users to ask their own research questions. But the process of getting there involves careful data entry and cross-referencing. The project team is not necessarily transcribing texts from beginning to end, they are extracting each data point in a way that fits their data model. They might not extract every piece of information, instead, they're letting their project goals guide them. Rest assured, both of these projects added to and refined their data model over time. If you have generated some research questions and drafted a data model, go ahead and open up a new spreadsheet. Label some fields, start filling in data, then step back and review your work. Does your source include information you forgot to put in your data model? Do these fields make sense to another person? Do you need another spreadsheet? On the flip side, are you trying to gather too much data? Do you need every single detail? If you're not sure how to answer these questions, why not skip ahead to visualization or analysis? Test out the data you've gathered so far, even if it's not complete, just to see how it performs. Again, this iterative approach is key to creating a workable project. Finding data # You may determine that your project or your constraints require that you find existing data sources. That's great! You're reusing existing information in new ways! But it can be a struggle to find the exact data set you're looking for. There is not one single catalog of data that you can use to find what you're looking for. You may have to combine pieces of multiple data sets. Alternatively, you may not have access or be legally allowed to use the data you're seeking. It's another reason to identify other scholars working on similar topic, you may be able to ask advice or find guidance. Analyzing your data # Okay, let's say you have put together a respectable data set that you think addresses your goals. What next? Throughout this coursebook, we have explored a range of analysis methods. Your research questions should help you determine the method or methods that make sense. But once you start using a method or visualizing your data, how do you know when you're getting answers? Here are some things to keep in mind: Know your material. It's up to you and your understanding of your subject to determine what matters. If you've generated a network graph, but you don't know much about the major players, you're going to struggle. Let your visualizations inspire you to dig back into research topics. Set benchmarks. Running a process once or creating one visualization isn't enough. Perform your analysis methods over and over so you have a sense of what is normal vs. extreme. You might also find errors in your data this way. If you're interested in how often the word \"love\" is used over time, you might want to try synonyms of that word. Do all words behave the same way? What are the trends over time? Is that actually a unique line on your graph? Remember your discipline. Positioning your work within a discipline is not an arbitrary decision. It gives you standards and priorities for your work. A literary scholar is going to approach a text differently than a historian. They're going to care about different questions. If you're a historian, you might be intrigued by the use of literary symbolism in a text, but know that you have to focus on the historical elements, not the style. Read the literature of the discipline and review other projects to get a sense of how their analysis works. Case study: Spanish Gallery # To pull this all together, let's walk through a case study of a project from a former student, Alice. Alice is an art history major with some experience in digital methods from other classes and her work on a DH project. In one of her classes, she learns about the Spanish Gallery . The Spanish Gallery was assembled at the Louvre by King Louis Phillipe in 1838 to showcase Spanish art during a time of French occupation of Spain. After his death, the gallery was sent to auction in London and dispersed into private hands. Alice wonders what happened to these paintings after the auction, as well as their origins in Spain. She imagines what the gallery might have looked like all assembled, similar to a project she put together on Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery . In reading the Wikipedia article, she notices a link to the digital copy of the gallery catalog from 1838. She recognizes these catalog as a potential source of data, especially when combined with her knowledge of searching auction records. The catalog is arranged in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief bio, then a list of the paintings and their dimensions. Alice sees that the digital book is available to download as plain text, which will make it easier to work with. She also notices that the text isn't quite perfect, so she will need to budget time for correction. Not to mention it's all in French! Finally, there appear to be annotations in pencil on the pages, so that may be something to look into. Alice opens Google Sheets and gets to work on this spreadsheet . The catalog has assigned each painting a number, so she uses that as an ID field. The thing that is being described in each row is the painting, with the artist, bio, size, location modifying that painting. After starting that work, she realizes that it's repetitive to include the art information multiple times, so she creates a second sheet that is just a list of the artists and their information. She cleverly uses a built-in translation feature in Google sheets to translate the French to English for the whole column, rather than doing it one by one: =GOOGLETRANSLATE(B2, \"fr\", \"en\") . Alice can't help but start researching the modern locations of these pieces of art. She finds that this work is going to be more challenging than she anticipated, so she creates another sheet to separate this work into a second phase of the project. There just aren't enough accessible records for each piece of work. Phase 1 will have to be about creating data on the gallery itself, Phase 2 will concern the auction and dispersal of the art. Similarly, finding the original locations of the art may be challenging too, since the catalog only lists where the artist was from. She knows another student who has used Google Street View and tourist websites to confirm the location of shrines in Spain. She supposes that's Phase 3! Alice's project is still in progress, but hopefully this example gave you an idea of how a project like this can change as it progresses.

It's another reason to identify other scholars working on similar topic, you may be able to ask advice or find guidance.","title":"Finding data"},{"location":"process/#analyzing-your-data","text":"Okay, let's say you have put together a respectable data set that you think addresses your goals. What next? Throughout this coursebook, we have explored a range of analysis methods. Your research questions should help you determine the method or methods that make sense. But once you start using a method or visualizing your data, how do you know when you're getting answers? Here are some things to keep in mind: Know your material. It's up to you and your understanding of your subject to determine what matters. If you've generated a network graph, but you don't know much about the major players, you're going to struggle. Let your visualizations inspire you to dig back into research topics. Set benchmarks. Running a process once or creating one visualization isn't enough. Perform your analysis methods over and over so you have a sense of what is normal vs. extreme. You might also find errors in your data this way. If you're interested in how often the word \"love\" is used over time, you might want to try synonyms of that word. Do all words behave the same way? What are the trends over time? Is that actually a unique line on your graph? Remember your discipline. Positioning your work within a discipline is not an arbitrary decision. It gives you standards and priorities for your work. A literary scholar is going to approach a text differently than a historian. They're going to care about different questions. If you're a historian, you might be intrigued by the use of literary symbolism in a text, but know that you have to focus on the historical elements, not the style. Read the literature of the discipline and review other projects to get a sense of how their analysis works.","title":"Analyzing your data"},{"location":"process/#case-study-spanish-gallery","text":"To pull this all together, let's walk through a case study of a project from a former student, Alice. Alice is an art history major with some experience in digital methods from other classes and her work on a DH project. In one of her classes, she learns about the Spanish Gallery . The Spanish Gallery was assembled at the Louvre by King Louis Phillipe in 1838 to showcase Spanish art during a time of French occupation of Spain. After his death, the gallery was sent to auction in London and dispersed into private hands. Alice wonders what happened to these paintings after the auction, as well as their origins in Spain. She imagines what the gallery might have looked like all assembled, similar to a project she put together on Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery . In reading the Wikipedia article, she notices a link to the digital copy of the gallery catalog from 1838. She recognizes these catalog as a potential source of data, especially when combined with her knowledge of searching auction records. The catalog is arranged in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief bio, then a list of the paintings and their dimensions. Alice sees that the digital book is available to download as plain text, which will make it easier to work with. She also notices that the text isn't quite perfect, so she will need to budget time for correction. Not to mention it's all in French! Finally, there appear to be annotations in pencil on the pages, so that may be something to look into. Alice opens Google Sheets and gets to work on this spreadsheet . The catalog has assigned each painting a number, so she uses that as an ID field. The thing that is being described in each row is the painting, with the artist, bio, size, location modifying that painting. After starting that work, she realizes that it's repetitive to include the art information multiple times, so she creates a second sheet that is just a list of the artists and their information. She cleverly uses a built-in translation feature in Google sheets to translate the French to English for the whole column, rather than doing it one by one: =GOOGLETRANSLATE(B2, \"fr\", \"en\") . Alice can't help but start researching the modern locations of these pieces of art. She finds that this work is going to be more challenging than she anticipated, so she creates another sheet to separate this work into a second phase of the project. There just aren't enough accessible records for each piece of work. Phase 1 will have to be about creating data on the gallery itself, Phase 2 will concern the auction and dispersal of the art. Similarly, finding the original locations of the art may be challenging too, since the catalog only lists where the artist was from. She knows another student who has used Google Street View and tourist websites to confirm the location of shrines in Spain. She supposes that's Phase 3! Alice's project is still in progress, but hopefully this example gave you an idea of how a project like this can change as it progresses.","title":"Case study: Spanish Gallery"},{"location":"process/#resources","text":"","title":"Resources"},{"location":"protocols/","text":"Course protocols # If you have ever labeled yourself as \u201cbad at technology,\u201d you are welcome in this course.

Start with the Alumni Coeducation Correspondence, May 10, 1984 (report) from the W&L Digital Archive . Take some time to read through the report, making note of the content and how it is presented. How are the first few pages different than the rest? Create your data model in a Box note for your group in this folder. Look over all the types of information included in the report. Choose what fields you think you should include. Why are you choosing those fields? How would these fields be useful in exploring/visualizing the data? Will your data collection enable certain research questions? Is there anything you can leave out? Once your model is set up, go ahead and start transcribing the data. Each team will be assigned a few pages to transcribe into this Google spreadsheet. Try to avoid looking at other team's sheets. We want to be able to compare the differences at the end of this activity. After we come back from the small groups, compare your data model to that of other groups and answer the following questions. How are the models different? What did your group include that others didn't and visa versa? How do your fields change the questions you can ask the data? How could you use Open Refine to clean up the data you created?
