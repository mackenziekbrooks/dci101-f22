### Week 1 Assignments

**Due by Tuesday at 12pm**

#### Blog post #1

What brought you to this class? How do you relate to digital culture and information? What do you find most interesting? Concerning? What personal goals do you have for this class - skills you want to develop or topics you want to explore?

**Specifications:**

* Create a WordPress post, then turn in the URL in Canvas. 
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

#### Activity log #1 - the internet's earliest memory of you

At the beginning of this course, I asked you your earliest memory of the internet. For this activity, let's turn that question around. What is the internet's earliest memory of you? Write a short biography of yourself using information that can be found online about you, preferably in public with no logging in. Use Google and the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to search for youself and anything in your web history. What can you find? What *can't* you find? What is surprising? What has been erased? 

After you've dug around and composed the bio, let's hear a little about the process. What was easy to find? Difficult? How has your web presence changed over time? What were you taught about using the internet with respect to privacy and how have your thoughts changed over time? How much of the content was on social media vs. another site (your school, team, etc)? If a researcher from the future is trying to learn about you, what are they missing out on? 

**Specifications:** 

* Create a WordPress page, then turn in the URL in Canvas. If you feel more comfortable keeping this page private, that's fine, just include the password when you submit.
* 50-100 word bio. 250-500 words on process. 
* Include links and images as you're comfortable. If you do not want to link to an old webpage, consider a screenshot.

#### Week 2 Assignments

**Due by Tuesday at 12pm**

#### Blog post #2 - Where does your Internet come from?

Using the information we learned this week about how the Internet works, what can you figure out about where *your* internet comes from? Without encroaching on any closet or area of campus you shouldn't, what can you discern through observation about the network that provides you with limitless wifi? Start in your dorm room or classroom, but pay attention as you walk through campus. Where does the wifi drop out? Can you the spot the routers? Where do you think the wires are hidden? Are there overlooked spaces on campus that suddenly seem important to this story? Bonus: can you find the data center on campus? 

This post should be a narration of the technological landscape of campus, along with 3-5 pictures to illustrate your findings. 

**Specs:**
* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 
* Include 3-5 images of the sites of Internet presence that you notice on campus. 


#### Activity log #2

Time to create your own Geocities-style website! Using the HTML and CSS skills you've learned this week, construct a small website about yourself, your interests, your fandoms, your pets - whatever you want! You'll upload this website to your domain. 

**Specs:**
* Create minimum of 2 HTML pages and 1 CSS document. 
* Upload to a subdirectory of your domain, then turn in the link on Canvas. If my domain was `https://brooksm.wludci.info` and I uploaded my files to a folder called `newsite` then I would turn in the URL `https://brooksm.wludci.info/newsite`. 
* Include the following:
	* images
	* table
	* links to a second page and external site (open in a new tab)
	* background color
	* style your links
	* use divs, add padding/margin to move content around on your pages


# Week 3 - The algorithm made me do it

They're seemingly everywhere, influencing all your decisions. What to buy, who to date, what to watch, who to hire? *Algorithm* is a common enough word these days, but do we know what they are? What they do? Can we blame everything on the algorithm?
