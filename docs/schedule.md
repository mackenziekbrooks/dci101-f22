## Activity log week 2

**Due Monday 1/25 at 12pm**

1. Complete [Activity 2.3](../your-computer/#activity-23). In Canvas, submit a document with your answers. It is more important that you show your process, thinking, and attempts than it is that you get everything right. It it totally acceptable to Google your way to an answer, just credit the sites that helped you answer the questions. This activity is designed to be a bit hard and to get you thinking about how to solve problems! 
2. Blog post #2: Respond to the following prompt in a 500 word blog post on your Wordpress. In Canvas, submit the URL the blog post. Prompt:
	- To help us conceptualize humanities data projects, let's look at a few more projects and the accompanying reviews. Scholarly articles and books are typically reviewed by other experts in the field. There are established procedures and venues for this kind of work, however DH projects do not always fit into those procedures. [Reviews in DH](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org) is a new publication that "bridges the gap" by providing reviews of projects. For this blog post, you will explore and write about a project **before** reading the accompanying review, then read the review and see how your analysis lines up. 
	- First, take a look at the [Review Content](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/review-process) (scroll down to get to this section. 
	- Next, select a project to review. The projects on this list have been selected to fit with the content of this course. *Remember, don't read the review until you've written about the project yourself!*
		- [Twit Lit](https://twitlit.github.io/) | [Project Review](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/project-twitter-literature/release/1)
		- [Shakespeare and Company Project](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/) | [Project Review](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/shakespeare-and-company-project/release/1    )
		- [Mapping Marronage](http://mapping-marronage.rll.lsa.umich.edu/) | [Project Review](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/mapping-marronage/release/3)
		- [Mapping the Gay Guides](https://www.mappingthegayguides.org/) | [Project Review](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/mapping-the-gay-guides/release/1)
		- [The GeoNewsMiner](https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/GeoNewsMiner/) | [Project Review](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/geonewsminer/release/2)
	- Write 200-300 on the project, using the *Reviews in DH* guidelines. Remember, you are not an expert yet, so you may not be able to address all aspects of the project.
	- Now read the accompanying review. What did you learn? How did it compare to your review? Write another 200-300 words on the differences in your reviews and the new concepts or approaches you learned. This blog is about process and learning! You are not expected to know everything already! I want to see how you are engaging with new material. 

**For Tuesday:**

* Read the [Data](data.md) chapter by class time.

1. Submit your answers from [Activity 3.3](../data/#activity-33) via a document in Canvas.  
2. Blog post #3: Respond to the following prompt in 400-500 words. Time to start thinking about your project! You will conduct this project on your own, though we'll have plenty of opportunities for peer review and feedback. You will choose your topic, so it's time to start brainstorming. What types of humanities-based topics do you find compelling? What subjects are you interested in school and out of school? What might make a good data-driven topic?

You may have to clean up fields in Open Refine or Excel to get the results you're looking for. You do not have to use ALL the data, you can slice it in ways that make sense to you (veterans from the 20th century or certain occupations from the 19th etc etc). Post at least 2-3 visualizations, along with a 300-400 word blog post on your results. What is your goal with these visualizations? How do they help you understand the data? How did you put these graphs together? Did you have to clean the data or look up how to create the graph? What did you struggle with? Are you happy with the results? What might you want to do with more time/skills? What have you learned about data visualization? 

**For Tuesday**
