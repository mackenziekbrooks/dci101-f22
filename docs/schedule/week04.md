# Week 4 - Data
*Sure big data is nice, but have you ever tried handcrafted artisanal data? This week weâ€™ll learn how data is made by creating it from scratch.*

## Read for Tuesday: 

* [Data](https://mackenziekbrooks.github.io/humanities-data/data/) - DCI 102 Coursebook
* [Defining Data for Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/defining-data-for-humanists-by-trevor-owens/) - Owens
* [Data + Design](https://trinachi.github.io/data-design-builds/ch01.html) - Chapters 1, 7, 12. Take a look around at the rest.

* Activity 4.1 - let's make some data! 
	* Start with the [Alumni Coeducation Correspondence, May 10, 1984 (report)](https://dspace.wlu.edu/handle/11021/34413) from the [W&L Digital Archive](https://dspace.wlu.edu/). Take some time to read through the report, making note of the content and how it is presented. How are the first few pages different than the rest?
    * Create your data model in a Box note for your group in this folder. Look over all the types of information included in the report. Choose what fields you think you should include. Why are you choosing those fields? How would these fields be useful in exploring/visualizing the data? Will your data collection enable certain research questions? Is there anything you can leave out?
    * Once your model is set up, go ahead and start transcribing the data. Each team will be assigned a few pages to transcribe into this Google spreadsheet. Try to avoid looking at other team's sheets. We want to be able to compare the differences at the end of this activity.
	* After we come back from the small groups, compare your data model to that of other groups and answer the following questions.
        * How are the models different?
        * What did your group include that others didn't and vice versa?
        * How do your fields change the questions you can ask the data?
        * How could you use Open Refine to clean up the data you created?

## Week 4 Assignments - Due Tuesday at 12pm

### Blog post #4 - data viz interrogation
Let's make sure you can think critically about professional visualizations that are designed to persuade. This blog post focuses on the audience and argument of visualizations. Go out into the wilds of the internet and find a visualization that speaks to you. Answer the following questions:

* What is this visualization trying to convey? Is it successful? Does it convince you? Why or why not? Would the piece work without the visualization?
* Does the style suit the data? How so? What other visualization styles would work?
* Who made this visualization? What is their background?
* Who is the audience and what is the context?
* What is source of the data of this visualization? Can you find the original data set? Where did you look? What format is it in?
* What else could be done with this data set? Other research questions? Other visualizations?
* Can you attempt to recreate this visualization? Improve on it? What tools/skills would you need?


**Specs:** 

* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 300-500 words.
* Be sure to link/embed the data viz of your choice.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos.
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it!


### Activity log #4 - new old data 

This week we went through the process of creating a data set from scratch, determining some research questions, then creating data visualizations. We also read a chapter about "What Gets Counted Counts" and the ways that bias can affect the results of any data-driven projects. For this activity, I'm going to hand you a new data set and it's your job to make sense of it. What can you determine about its creation? What are some of its issues? What research questions might it inspire? Can you create a basic data visualization? What silences or gaps are in this data set? Spend some time just browsing around before you dive into answering the questions.

**Specs:** 

* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* Answer the following:
    * Who created this data set? 
    * What does this data contain? Provide a narrative summary and a list of the fields.
    * What are some issues with this data? What inconsistencies do you notice? Why might these be an issue? 
    * What research questions does this data set prompt? How might different disciplines approach this data differently? Give an example.
    * What further research might you need to do to make sense of this data? What websites or sources would be useful? Give an example. 
* Create 1-2 data visualizations using this data set. You should definitely consider only using a small subset of the data. You almost certainly will have to clean up the data a little bit. You can use Excel or any of the other platforms we talked about in class. Embed these visualizations on the page.
