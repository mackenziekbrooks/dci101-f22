# Week 4 - Data
*Sure big data is nice, but have you ever tried handcrafted artisanal data? This week weâ€™ll learn how data is made by creating it from scratch.*

### Read for Tuesday: 

* [Data](https://mackenziekbrooks.github.io/humanities-data/data/) - DCI 102 Coursebook
* [Defining Data for Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/defining-data-for-humanists-by-trevor-owens/) - Owens

* Activity 4.1 - let's make some data! 
	* Start with the [Alumni Coeducation Correspondence, May 10, 1984 (report)](https://dspace.wlu.edu/handle/11021/34413) from the [W&L Digital Archive](https://dspace.wlu.edu/). Take some time to read through the report, making note of the content and how it is presented. How are the first few pages different than the rest?
    * Create your data model in a Box note for your group in this folder. Look over all the types of information included in the report. Choose what fields you think you should include. Why are you choosing those fields? How would these fields be useful in exploring/visualizing the data? Will your data collection enable certain research questions? Is there anything you can leave out?
    * Once your model is set up, go ahead and start transcribing the data. Each team will be assigned a few pages to transcribe into this Google spreadsheet. Try to avoid looking at other team's sheets. We want to be able to compare the differences at the end of this activity.
	* After we come back from the small groups, compare your data model to that of other groups and answer the following questions.
        * How are the models different?
        * What did your group include that others didn't and visa versa?
        * How do your fields change the questions you can ask the data?
        * How could you use Open Refine to clean up the data you created?
