# Week 3 - The algorithm made me do it

*They're seemingly everywhere, influencing all your decisions. What to buy, who to date, what to watch, who to hire? Algorithm is a common enough word these days, but do we know what they are? What they do? Can we blame everything on the algorithm? What about AI or machine learning? Oh and what about ethics?*

* Activity: reverse engineer an algorithm. Each team will be assigned a platform (Netflix, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).
	1. Create a Boxnote in our folder for your team. 
	2. Work together to answer the following: 
		* Who created this platform? Who owns it? Are those the same thing?
		* Where does the money come from? 
		* Where does the content come from? Are creators paid? Do they own their creations? 
		* Give me a brief idea of the user experience. What happens on this platform? 
		* Where do you suspect algorithms are working? How do you know? What are they doing? 
		* How does your experience of the platform differ from your classmates'? 
		* Where do the problems lie? Where could bias enter? 
		* Suggest some alterations to the way this platform functions.

## Week 3 Assignments - Due Tuesday at 12pm

### Blog post #3 
Let’s start brainstorming about potential project topics. What are you interested in? What’s compelling about your major/minor? How do DCI concepts fit into that topic? If you don't have a major/minor yet, could this be a way to explore a topic related to a potential area of interest? Maybe you want to dive into something you haven't had a chance to explore in college yet. Think broadly! 

Next, what questions do you have about that topic? Take a look at the [final project description](../../assignments/#digital-essay) to get a sense of what you'll be doing with the digital essay. 

**Specs:** 
	
* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it!
