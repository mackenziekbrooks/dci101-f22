Office hours: Mondays 10a-12pm, Thursdays 2-3pm, or by appointment. Please don't hesitate to schedule a meeting with me! I have a lot of meetings in my work life and can't always honor office hours. I'm usually on campus five days a week and happy to meet outside of office hours (but still between 9am-5pm.) 

## Course description
What does it mean to be a citizen of a digital world? How do you think critically about the ways that technology shapes our society? How do you learn new digital skills when platforms are constantly changing? How do you find and use information effectively without being overwhelmedor mislead?

Through hands-on activities and project-based learning, this course serves as an introduction to the study of digital culture and information. Students will develop the critical capacity and technological fluency necessary to understand, analyze, critique, and create in a world dominated by digital media, software algorithms, and information overload.

## Course objectives

Students will:

* Develop awareness of themselves as citizens of a digital world with accompanying rights and responsibilities.
* Build the technical skills necessary for academic, professional, and personal success. 
* Communicate effectively and ethically with digital media to academic and general audiences. 
* Create a digital project in a multi-disciplinary, collaborative environment.


## DCI Learning Outcomes
* Develop critical capacities for analyzing the role of technology and digital media in contemporary culture, and apply those capacities to a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary inquiries.
* Develop the technical skills necessary for academic and professional success, with an emphasis on online communication and information.
* Demonstrate the ability to communicate across different media and to both academic and general audiences.
* Engage in collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based learning.
* Develop digital projects that contribute to the scholarly conversation in the student's field of study and demonstrate an awareness of the technological and critical needs of the discipline.
* Develop an online professional identity and a portfolio of work in the minor.


## Course protocols

* If you have ever labeled yourself as “bad at technology,” you are welcome in this course. There is no assumed technical skill. 
* "Technology" is a lot of things. Chances are you will know something about it that your classmates do not. Be generous about teaching and learning from each other. See also: [https://xkcd.com/1053/](https://xkcd.com/1053/)
* Your laptop will be a major player in this course, even more than usual. Please make sure it is good working order by updating software \(operating system, browers, etc\) and visiting the IT help desk as necessary. 
* That being said, using your laptop in class is not an invitation to distraction. Look up how to disable notifications since you will have to share your screen in class.
* This course will mix theory and hands-on work. Be prepared to think critically about technology AND to get your hands dirty in a little bit of code.
* The DH community values experimentation and productive failure, often in public. We will learn from how and why things don’t work. We are not just going to talk about what we’re learning but how we’re learning it. Give yourself a break from perfectionism!

You will be provided with a domain from [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) in the format ```http://username.wludci.info```.

## Policies

### Accommodations

I am committed to ensuring access to course content for all students. Reasonable accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Contact Lauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, to confidentially discuss your needs and the accommodation process. More information can be found at: https://www.wlu.edu/disability-accommodations/undergraduate-accommodations

If you have already been approved for accommodations, please meet with me within the first two weeks of the term so we can develop an implementation plan together. It is important to meet as early in the term as possible; this will ensure that your accommodations are implemented early on. If you have accommodations for test-taking, please remember that arrangements must be made at least a week before the date of the test or exam.

### Attendance

You may notice that I do not factor in attendance and participation into your grade. This is on purpose. I design my classes so that you can't *not* participate. Class sessions are structured to help you advance your learning, not just for you to receive content. If you miss a lot of class, it will affect your grade because you aren't learning what you need to learn to fulfill assignments, not because I've docked a point. But life happens and sometimes you need a day or two. Or a pandemic happens and we all need a break. I expect that you'll talk to me about these instances and take responsibility for catching up on what you've missed. 

### Plagiarism

All writing should be your own or should be cited properly. The writing assignments in this course are different than what is required in other courses, so we will discuss proper citation procedures for writing for the Web, writing in a group, and writing technical documentation.
